# The Power of MDX in Astro

MDX is a powerful combination of Markdown and JSX that allows you to use components directly in your Markdown content. This is a game-changer for content creation.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX extends Markdown by allowing you to include JSX components directly in your content. This means you can:

- Include interactive components in your blog posts
- Reuse UI components within your content
- Create dynamic content that responds to user input

## Example Component

Here's the theme toggle component included directly in this MDX file:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <ThemeToggle />
</div>

## Code Example

```jsx
// This is a React component
export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Using JavaScript Expressions

MDX also allows you to use JavaScript expressions directly in your content:

Current date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}

## Dynamic Content

You can create truly dynamic content with MDX. Here's a simple example of using JavaScript to generate content:

{
  ['React', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Solid'].map(framework => (
    <li key={framework}>{framework} is awesome!</li>
  ))
}

## Conclusion

MDX brings the power of components to your Markdown content, allowing for more interactive and dynamic blog posts. It's a perfect match for Astro's component islands architecture.
